sentiment lab file, IMDB review, palying with speed, frequency, cutoff the work, also added stop words. cosine similarity and 
T-SNE added. speed by droppping the sparse part of vocabulary and using only indices of existing words improved over 10 time,
Xivier initilization also improve the results. using polarity and min_count for removing repeated words that are not useful, low caount of words,
and keeping most polar words with which are at polar oppsitive of positive/negative ratio did not significantly increased trainig over 84%
(as well as removing stop words). If train the network at without re-initilization run again based on last exsiting weright accuracy of
the training increase to ~93% by test set show high variance and accuracy drop.
